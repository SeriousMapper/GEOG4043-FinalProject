The space - time cube revisited from a geovisualization perspective

    Computer Science

At the end of the sixties Hagerstrand introduced a space-time model which included features such as a Space-TimePath, and a Space-Time-Prism. His model is often seen as the start of the time-geography studies. Throughout the years his model has been applied and improved to understand our movements through space. Problems studied can be found in different fields of geography, and range from those on an individual movement to whole theories to optimize transportation. From a visualization…  Expand
