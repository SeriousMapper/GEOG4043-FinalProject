This page collates data sources for all inland transport modes (including public transport, road and rail network traffic, inland freight transport, vehicle registrations, road safety) as well as maritime and/or port traffic, produced on a short-term basis that give insights into the Coronavirus impact on transport systems. Most sources come from UNECE member State official sources.

See the blog page for some interesting examples, updated as data become available. Last updated on 16 November.

New:  Provisional monthly road safety data for 20 countries have been collated into a dataset, see this new page .
