   Project Description: Our main goal is to find the effect of COVID-19 on bus ridership and frequency of RTD buses in the Denver Metropolitan area. We will visualize socioeconomic factors (such as economic inequality) in comparison to rider density and bus routes. This project is aimed towards users interested in how public transportation has been affected by the current pandemic. The significance of this project is the spatiotemporal impact on rider transportation in the face of a sudden change to public transit accessibility.
