We're Looking for New Mobile Apps, Widgets, and Tools

Want to help RTD riders get transit info on the go? We welcome and encourage third-party developers with first-class ideas for cool apps, widgets and other tools that make riding RTD even easier!

We are committed to supporting the development community in whatever way we can. We supply static schedule data in the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), real time vehicle locations and arrival predictions in the GTFS-RT format, as well as GIS files in ESRI shapefile formats. All of this data is available for you to use for developing your app.

Once your app is available to the public be sure to drop us a line at  developer@rtd-denver.com . We review all submissions and the best ones may get posted on our  mobile apps  page.
